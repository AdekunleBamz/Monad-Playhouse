# ðŸŽ¯ Monad Playhouse - MGID Integration Complete

## âœ… Implementation Status

The Monad Playhouse has been successfully updated to use **Monad Games ID (MGID)** as the primary authentication and leaderboard system. The previous Privy-only implementation has been replaced with a focused MGID integration that follows the official MGID integration guide.

## ðŸ”§ What Changed

### 1. Authentication System (`mgid-auth.js`)
- **Removed**: Hybrid login system with wallet + Privy
- **Added**: Dedicated MGID authentication using Privy Global Wallet
- **Features**:
  - Uses `loginMethodsAndOrder: ['privy:cmd8euall0037le0my79qpz42']`
  - Automatic MGID wallet detection
  - Username lookup via MGID API
  - Registration prompts for users without usernames

### 2. Leaderboard System (`mgid-leaderboard.js`)
- **Removed**: Basic leaderboard with wallet/Privy distinction
- **Added**: MGID-focused leaderboard with global integration
- **Features**:
  - Game-specific leaderboards
  - Global cross-game rankings
  - Direct link to official MGID global leaderboard
  - Tab-based interface for different leaderboard views

### 3. Server Implementation (`mgid-leaderboard-server.js`)
- **Removed**: Hybrid authentication server
- **Added**: MGID-focused server with contract integration
- **Features**:
  - Direct submission to MGID contract (`updatePlayerData`)
  - Automatic username resolution
  - MongoDB storage for local leaderboards
  - Global leaderboard aggregation

### 4. Game Registration Script (`register-game-mgid.js`)
- **Ready**: Script to register with MGID contract
- **Function**: Uses `registerGame()` with game details
- **Details**:
  - Game Name: "Monad Playhouse"
  - Game Image: Favicon URL
  - Game URL: Production URL
  - Game Address: Contract address for score submission

## ðŸŽ® How MGID Integration Works

### User Flow
1. **Sign In**: User clicks "ðŸŽ¯ Sign in with Monad Games ID"
2. **Privy Modal**: Privy shows MGID-specific login options
3. **Wallet Creation**: MGID creates embedded wallet automatically
4. **Username Check**: System checks if user has registered username
5. **Registration Prompt**: If no username, prompts user to register
6. **Score Submission**: Scores submitted to both local DB and MGID contract

### Technical Flow
1. **Frontend**: `mgid-auth.js` handles authentication
2. **Score Submission**: Calls MGID contract `updatePlayerData(player, scoreAmount, transactionAmount)`
3. **Leaderboard**: Shows local + global + official MGID leaderboards
4. **Username**: Retrieved from `https://monad-games-id-site.vercel.app/api/check-wallet`

## ðŸ”— MGID Contract Integration

### Contract Address
```
0xceCBFF203C8B6044F52CE23D914A1bfD997541A4
```

### Functions Used
- `registerGame(address _game, string _name, string _image, string _url)`
- `updatePlayerData(address player, uint256 scoreAmount, uint256 transactionAmount)`

### Score Submission Process
1. Player completes game
2. Frontend calls `mgidAuth.submitScore()`
3. Server validates score
4. Server calls MGID contract `updatePlayerData()`
5. Score appears on global MGID leaderboard

## ðŸ“Š Leaderboard Features

### Three Leaderboard Views
1. **Game-Specific**: Shows top players for current game
2. **Global**: Aggregated scores across all games in our app
3. **MGID Official**: Link to the complete cross-game leaderboard

### Data Sources
- **Local MongoDB**: Fast access to game-specific scores
- **MGID Contract**: Global cross-game data
- **MGID API**: Username resolution and verification

## ðŸš€ Deployment Requirements
